//console.log(age);   we can't access the variable outside the function , but if we'll declare it globally we can use it throughout the program.
// solve();

// const a = 25; 
//a = 35; we can't redefine the value of variable which is declared as constant , it's it will remain constant throughout the program. 

// always use variable naming convention as camel case , and it should be meaningful.
// also don't use the reserved keywords to declare the variables , as it will through error while running a program.
