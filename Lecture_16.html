    <!-- Today we're going to learn about block elements and Inline elements. -->
    <!-- Every HTML element has a default display value, depending on what type of element it is.

      --  The two most common display values are block and inline.

     --  Block-level Elements
            A block-level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically add some space (a margin) before and after the element.

     --     A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).

     --     Two commonly used block elements are: <p> and <div>.

     --     The <p> element defines a paragraph in an HTML document.

     --     The <div> element defines a division or a section in an HTML document.

      --    The <p> element is a block-level element.

      --    The <div> element is a block-level element. 
        
            Here are the block-level elements in HTML:

            <address>
            <article>
            <aside>
            <blockquote>
            <canvas>
            <dd>
            <div>
            <dl>
            <dt>
            <fieldset>
            <figcaption>
            <figure>
            <footer>
            <form>
            <h1>-<h6>
            <header>
            <hr>
            <li>
            <main>
            <nav>
            <noscript>
            <ol>
            <p>
            <pre>
            <section>
            <table>
            <tfoot>
            <ul>
            <video>
        
        
        
     --- Inline Elements
            An inline element does not start on a new line.

            An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary.

            This is a <span> element inside a paragraph. while working with the span element which is inline element , to make 
            it block elemet , we've to write it as 'display : block ;' , now our inline span element will behave like a block emement.
        -- Same for the block element , if we've to display the block element as an inline element we just have to write it as : display : inline;
        -- Then the block element will behave like a inline element. 
    Here are the inline elements in HTML:

        <a>
        <abbr>
        <acronym>
        <b>
        <bdo>
        <big>
        <br>
        <button>
        <cite>
        <code>
        <dfn>
        <em>
        <i>
        <img>
        <input>
        <kbd>
        <label>
        <map>
        <object>
        <output>
        <q>
        <samp>
        <script>
        <select>
        <small>
        <span>
        <strong>
        <sub>
        <sup>
        <textarea>
        <time>
        <tt>
        <var>
        

        The display: inline-block Value
            Compared to display: inline, the major difference is that display: inline-block allows to set a width and height on the element.

            Also, with display: inline-block, the top and bottom margins/paddings are respected, but with display: inline they are not.

            Compared to display: block, the major difference is that display: inline-block does not add a line-break after the element, so the element can sit next to other elements.
