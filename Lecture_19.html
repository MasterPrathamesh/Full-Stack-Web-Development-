    <!-- In this we'll learn about "CSS LAYOUT - Float and Clear." -->
    <!-- The CSS float property specifies how an element should float.

    The CSS clear property specifies what elements can float beside the cleared element and on which side. 
    
    The float Property
    The float property is used for positioning and formatting content e.g. let an image float left to the text in a container.

    The float property can have one of the following values:

    left - The element floats to the left of its container
    right - The element floats to the right of its container
    none - The element does not float (will be displayed just where it occurs in the text). This is default
    inherit - The element inherits the float value of its parent
    In its simplest use, the float property can be used to wrap text around images.



    The clear Property
    When we use the float property, and we want the next element below (not on right or left), we will have to use the clear property.

    The clear property specifies what should happen with the element that is next to a floating element.

    The clear property can have one of the following values:

    none - The element is not pushed below left or right floated elements. This is default
    left - The element is pushed below left floated elements
    right - The element is pushed below right floated elements
    both - The element is pushed below both left and right floated elements
    inherit - The element inherits the clear value from its parent
    When clearing floats, you should match the clear to the float: If an element is floated to the left, then you should clear to the left.
    Your floated element will continue to float, but the cleared element will appear below it on the web page.

            Lord Krishna: The Divine Enigma

            Lord Krishna, one of the most revered and celebrated deities in Hinduism, embodies a unique blend of divinity, wisdom, and playfulness. He is the eighth incarnation of Lord Vishnu, the preserver in the Hindu trinity, and is worshiped as the supreme god in his own right by millions worldwide. Krishna's life, as depicted in ancient scriptures like the Mahabharata, Bhagavata Purana, and the Bhagavad Gita, is a tapestry of extraordinary deeds, profound teachings, and divine love.

            The Birth of Krishna
            Krishna was born in Mathura to Devaki and Vasudeva during a tumultuous period when the tyrannical King Kamsa ruled. His birth was prophesied to end Kamsa's reign of terror, prompting the king to imprison his sister Devaki and kill her children. Krishna, however, was miraculously saved and transported to Gokul, where he was raised by Nanda and Yashoda. This episode underscores Krishna's divine mission to restore dharma (cosmic order) and eliminate adharma (evil).

            Krishna’s Early Life
            As a child, Krishna was adored for his mischievous yet endearing acts, earning him the title of "Makhan Chor" (butter thief). His playful pranks, such as stealing butter and teasing the gopis (cowherd girls), reflect his human-like qualities, making him relatable to devotees. At the same time, his miraculous feats, like lifting the Govardhan Hill to protect the villagers of Gokul from torrential rains, showcased his divine power and love for his devotees.

            Krishna’s Role in the Mahabharata
            One of Krishna’s most significant contributions is his role in the Mahabharata, an epic narrative of duty, morality, and righteousness. He served as a guide and charioteer to Arjuna, one of the Pandava princes, during the Kurukshetra War. When Arjuna hesitated to fight against his own kin, Krishna imparted the Bhagavad Gita, a timeless philosophical discourse. In it, Krishna elucidates concepts of duty, detachment, devotion, and the path to spiritual liberation. His teachings transcend time, offering profound insights into life and ethics.

            Krishna as a Lover and Friend
            Krishna’s relationship with Radha, his eternal consort, symbolizes the pinnacle of divine love and devotion. Their bond represents a union of the soul with the divine, transcending the boundaries of worldly love. Krishna's friendships, particularly with Sudama and the Pandavas, emphasize his humility and unwavering loyalty.

            Krishna’s Teachings and Legacy
            Lord Krishna's life and teachings have left an indelible mark on spiritual, cultural, and artistic traditions. His messages of universal love, selfless action, and the pursuit of truth continue to inspire millions. The celebration of Janmashtami, his birth anniversary, and festivals like Holi, associated with his playful deeds, highlight the joyous and colorful aspects of his persona.

            In essence, Krishna is not just a historical or mythological figure but a symbol of eternal wisdom and divine love. Whether as a mischievous child, a charismatic lover, a wise philosopher, or a compassionate guide, Krishna represents the multifaceted nature of divinity. His teachings and stories serve as a beacon of hope, guiding humanity toward a life of virtue, balance, and spiritual fulfillment.
